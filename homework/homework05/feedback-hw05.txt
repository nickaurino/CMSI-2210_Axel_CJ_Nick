 Total possible ~ 100 points

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 92/100 which is 92.00% which is an A-minus

SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Your wordcount.c got a compile error.  Line 24 [which I commented out] is
incorrect ~ you don't want to dereference the file pointer to check if it's
NULL, you just want the pointer itself.  Remember that 'dereferencing' with
the star '*' character gives you the value AT the address of the pointer.  I
fixed that error for you since it was quick and that way you're not dinged
for a program that won't run.  My fix is on line 25 of your file.

Your dec2bin program is echoing the number that is supposed to be converted
into the output binary string.  This is incorrect, but the binary seems to
be correct.

Your dec2hex program is giving the correct values most of the time, but in
a couple of cases there are extra characters in the output.

Your timesTables program doesn't work per the specification.  It is supposed
to create a table of the values that looks like this, given the input '4'
on the command line:

       2   3   4
   -------------
    2| 4   6   8
    3| 6   9  12
    4| 8  12  16

Your wordcount program doesn't get the correct number of words.  On the file
"inputfile.txt" that I provided, there are either 394 words, or 397 words,
depending on if you count newlines between paragraphs or not.  Your program
only counts 193.

========================================================
SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  90.00% of  5 points =  4.50 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~  86.67% of  5 points =  4.33 points
   homework05 ~  92.00% of 10 points =  9.20 points
                                total: 28.03 out of 30.0 = 93.43%
                                which is an A

Pretty nice job, just keep up the good work!
