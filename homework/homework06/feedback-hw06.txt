SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1 works perfectly!  Nice work.

problem 2 you have a linker error ~ the linker can't find the "calculateGCD"
   function, since you didn't put the underscore character in front of the
   name.  I fixed that for you, no charge.  Once I did that, it worked.  One
   thing to keep in mind, there are many times for which you will want to
   know not only that all tests passed, but that EACH test got the expected
   value returned.  For those, using a "printf()" statement to output an
   "expected .... actual ....." message are more useful than simply putting
   out a "WORKED" MESSAGE.  :)

problem 3 doesn't assemble on windows.  I get an error saying "impossible
   combination of address sizes."  On mac, it assembles, but linking gives a
   "_main" undefined symbol error.  I changed the code to make a "_main" for
   you and now everything assembles and links.  However, it gets a seg fault
   when I run it.

problem 4 works perfectly!  Excellent.

problem 5 doesn't compile because you are including a header file that does
   not exist.  There is no file "NBOC.h" in your directory, and you should
   never EVER include a ".c" file so that's not the fix.  I commented out
   the offending line and now it compiles and links fine.  However, I get
   no output when I run it.  This is because the "main()" in your program
   file is empty.  You need to figure out how to call the function from the
   main program and make sure there is a call to your function, which isn't
   in there at this point.  Nice try, though.....

problem 6, your byte data exceeds the bounds of the size you've specified as
   'db'.  You can't put anything larger than 255 into a single byte!  I fixed
   the code, but it costs you a bit.  Next, linking on mac has 7 errors, two
   are 'instruction not supported' and five are because of 32-bit absolute
   addresses in 64-bit mode.  Trying it on windows, it compiles and assembles
   fine but gets five linker errors about the '_test' function.  So, this
   doesn't run on either platform.

SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  90.00% of  5 points =  4.50 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~  86.67% of  5 points =  4.33 points
   homework05 ~  92.00% of 10 points =  9.20 points
   homework06 ~  83.00% of 15 points = 12.45 points
                       semester total: 40.48 out of 45.00 = 89.96%
                             which is an A-minus

Great work on this assignment, and you've done well for the entire semester!

Now on to the final exam.....
