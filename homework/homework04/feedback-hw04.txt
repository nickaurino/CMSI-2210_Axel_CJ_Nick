Total possible points        90 points

========================================================

TOTAL EARNED POINTS:
   you earned 78.0/ 90.0 which is 86.67% which is a B

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

On problem 1 part B, you aren't allowed to use NOT gates, only NAND gates.
You can make a NOT gate from a NAND gate by feeding one signal into both
of the NAND gate inputs.

On problem 2, good thinking using XOR gates!

On problem 6, the LOAD instructions which are before the READ instructions
aren't needed, since the READ will overwrite what's in the accumulator.  The
DIV instruction won't give you the remainder, only the quotient.  You need
to use the MOD intruction instead.  I don't think you understand the GCD
algorithm correctly, since you need to have a loop, and you need to do the
MOD operation each time.  You then need to check the value of 'value2' each
time and if it is zero you output 'value1' to the port.

On problem 7, you seem to have the LOAD/STORE and READ/WRITE operations mixed
up.  The former is for accumulator/memory transfers, and the latter is for
accumulator/port transfers.  Also, the problem says "code fragment", not an
entire program.

On problem 8, you need two conditions, one for greater than zero and one for
equal to zero.

Otherwise, good job!

========================================================
SEMESTER SCORE SO FAR:

   homework01 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework02 ~  90.00% of  5 points =  4.50 points
   homework03 ~ 100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   homework04 ~  86.67% of  5 points =  4.33 points
                                total: 18.83 out of 20.0 = 94.17%
                                which is a solid A

Keep up the good work!
